## Option 2: Mailto Fallback (Already Working) ‚úâÔ∏è

The form currently uses a **mailto** fallback, which:

- Pre-fills recipient, subject, and message
- Works immediately (no setup required)

**Note:** This method requires the user to have an email client configured on their device.

## Option 3: EmailJS (Alternative Free Service)

If you prefer EmailJS:

1. Sign up at: https://www.emailjs.com
2. Create an email service

4. Update `contact-form.js` with EmailJS integration
