Over the course of my career, I've guided organizations in renewable energy and technology through key stages of expansion, combining strategic planning with a hands-on, people-first approach.\n\nIn January 2024, I founded Color Disain Studio, a venture focused on digital transformation and the integration of AI into everyday business processes. My work today bridges two worlds I care deeply about: the human side of sales—trust, communication, and relationships—and the future of technology, where automation, design, and intelligence shape how companies operate.",
